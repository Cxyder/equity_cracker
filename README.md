# Equity Wallet Miner - Private Wallet Keys Guesser

EQUITY is fully open source and free, our algorithm is also the fastest ever seen in a wallet miner. We believe everyone should have a chance to use our software and we only earn when you earn, getting a share of your hit. 

## KNOWN ISSUES  
 There are still rare occurences of Ghost Hits, meaning "hits" where the Wallet is empty tho  
   
 If you use too many Threads (CPU-Intensity) there will be some Errors, however it won't crash and will continue to mine, but just be warned to sometimes see "New Error"

## TO-DO
> Fix Ghosthits (For me, I had 1 of them in like 40k checks)

## Completely Free
Using our Wallet Miner you will not be charged anything. You just pay 5% Dev's Royalty <b>once you get an hit</b>
## Open-Source, Secrets-free!
No malware, No spyware, No keylogger and other naughty stuff. We are the revolution among Wallet Mining.
## Multiprocessing
200 Mining Process, 1 Console. Minimal terms, always.

## Beside the codes & FAQ
### Code logic
"<i>Equity Wallet Miner</i>" is a loop code which objective (as every Wallet Miner) is to brute force crack an Ethereum wallet.
<b>How does this happen though?</b>
1. <i>Equity</i> generates a random possible ethereum private key hex
2. <i>Equity</i> tries to access using the generated possible private key
3. If private key is valid and <i>Equity</i> was able to access a wallet, it goes further. Otherwise it will return to <i>Step 1</i>. That's a <b>[BAD MATCH]</b>
4. <i>Equity</i> fetch acquired wallet ETH balance.
5. If fetched ETH balance is greater than 0,002 ETH(5$, writing time). It goes further. Otherwise it will return to to <i>Step 1</i>. That's a <b>[BAD HIT]</b>
6. Finally, if the overtaken wallet has enough ETH for transactions, <i>Equity</i> will automatically send the recovered ETH to your main ethereum address
7. Once transactions are submitted, <i>Equity</i> will display TxHASH and transferred balance.
8. <i>Equity</i> will continue trying to find another wallet. Repeating from <i>Step 1</i>

### Is it legal to use a program like this?
Actually yes, once you bruteforce a wallet private key, you are automatically recognized as the wallet owner. Therefore you are able to perform everything on that wallet

### "Download Now" button return an .exe file, why?
We compiled our files in a .exe file to make things more compact, tho if you don't trust us on .exe packaging you can compile software from Source Code by your own with Python

### How much time for an hit?
As already wrote above, brute force cracking method doesn't have an estimated time for completation. It may takes a long time as it may take a very short time.
